#Welcome to "Code-is-beautiful"

##About
<img align="left" src="/sunburst/sunburst.png?raw=true" width="300" alt="code-is-beautiful"> Code-is-beautiful is a cross-language project, aimed to create new / better ways to visualize source code.

##Who we are

Weâ€™re [QuantifiedCode](https://www.quantifiedcode.com), a Berlin-based startup. Our mission is to help programmers write better code! Therefore, we make state-of-the-art code analysis available to everyone. Our first product is an [online tool for automated, data-driven code review](https://www.quantifiedcode.com). When building this tool we learned a lot about code, code quality and code visualization. With this project we like to share our learnings back to the community and hope, with your support, to take code visualization to the next level.

##Status

We've just started, join us!

## How to contribute

Contributions are very welcome, and are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

### Contributor Licence Agreement

We are asking all past and future contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Every contributor of non-trivial amounts of code (more than just a line or two) is required to sign a CLA. If somebody is unable to sign the CLA, the contribution (e.g., code, documentation, translations) has unfortunately to be removed from the code-is-beautiful repository.

The CLA ensures that we have a clear licensing for all contributions, which in turn lets us guarantee to users that we have no "stray" intellectual property or differently-licensed material.

**Where do I sign? What's next?**

1. Download a copy of the CLA:
