# Sunburst (Hierarchical cie chart)

##About

<img align="left" src="/sunburst/sunburst.png?raw=true" width="300" alt="code-is-beautiful"> This is a visualization of the Flask Python source code, generated using [D3](http://www.d3js.org). Technically, it is a hierarchical pie chart, that looks like a sunburst.

To build this graph, you have to calculate the number of lines and number of characters of a source file. Using that information, you can generate a hierarchical graph of the code which shows the fraction of the total characters contained in each directory and file.

Using this visualization, it is easy to see how the code is distributed in the repository. You can click on individual segments to get a zoomed-in view of individual branches (click on the central element to get back to the last view).

##Usage

1. Checkout this repo
2. Change to the folder "sunburst"
3. Open index.html
